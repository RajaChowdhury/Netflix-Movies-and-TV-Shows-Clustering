I have built a content based clustering model using Python which can be deployed to provide a better user experience and to increase customer engagement and satisfaction.

## Description

This project is about Netflix Movies and TV Shows where third-party Netflix search engine released an interesting report which shows that the number of TV shows on Netflix has nearly tripled since 2010. The streaming serviceâ€™s number of movies has decreased by more than 2,000 titles since 2010, while its number of TV shows has nearly tripled. This excited me to explore what all other insights can be obtained from the same dataset.

The problem statement of Netflix movies and TV show clustering is to group similar content based on a set of features such as genre, cast, director, ratings, etc. This is done in order to make recommendations to the users based on their viewing history and preferences. The goal is to create homogeneous groups of content that are similar in terms of these features, so that users can easily find new content that they are likely to enjoy.
